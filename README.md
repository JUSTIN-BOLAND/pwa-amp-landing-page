# pwa-amp-landing-page

The goal of this project is to hack (to get near to perfect scores) the Google Pagespeed Insights/Lighthouse test scores which is used for assessing the speed and usability of websites and landing pages.

The template features common blocks used in many landing pages and is easy to configure by replacing text and images. The necessary PWA and AMP structures are in place, requiring just cosmetic changes to icons and names etc.

Note this template excludes the usage of Google Analytics tracking code because interestingly PageSpeed Insights javascripts get penalised by Google's scoring system and the same goes for AMP as well.
